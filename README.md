## Robert George - 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

Published GitHub website:
UGH, another long day and late Saturday night...

I thought I was going to get almost everything done before midnight but then I discovered a couple bugs related to the ending of the quiz.

To Do / Where I left off:

1. I bypassed one bug by advancing to the All done page after answering all 6 questions but have yet to get the remaining Time (Counter) to display next to "Your score:"

2. When I answer all questions WRONG:

- I am not able to get the screen to return to the startQuiz screen.

  - Instead I am taken to the All done screen. Which is set in the checkAnswer function in the Else after the last question is displayed and answered.

- Nor have I managed to get the Timer to display 0 (or even the negative Counter value).

  - Instead it displays the last Counter value before the last wrong answer was clicked that set the Counter score to a negative number.

3. I used Flexbox in the little CSS I did do. I will switch to Grid.

Almost midnight... Time to submit this to avoid being late.
Will get back to this tomorrow.
